# Target Companies

## Search Criteria

- **Role fits a profile**: not "kinda sorta" — actually matches
- **Real technical work**: agents, ML infra, retrieval, distributed systems (not GPT wrapper SaaS)
- **Location**: Open to anywhere. Currently in Syracuse, NY (temporarily). Home base Atlanta. Loves NYC (Park Slope / PLG / Prospect Park area ideal). Will relocate for the right role.
- **Comp floor**: Must cover living + dog (GSD, non-negotiable). Remote LCOL: $150K+. NYC: $180K+ (dog walker/daycare ~$500-1K/mo). SF: $200K+.
- **Stage preference**: Doesn't matter. Needs income NOW — urgency is real.
- **Dog constraint**: GSD needs daily exercise/attention. If in-person 5d/wk, need dog walker or nearby dog daycare. NYC Park Slope / Prospect Park area is ideal (park access).
- **Interview style**: Strongest in practical/portfolio-based. Weakest in DSA/competitive math. System design is doable with prep.
