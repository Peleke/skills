# Job Search Pipeline

Structured profiles, search criteria, and tracking for the 2026 job search.

## Profiles

Each profile is a "view" over the same experience, optimized for a specific role archetype.
The resume and cover letter stay the same; the *emphasis* shifts.

| Profile | File | Target roles |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Research Engineer | `profiles/research-engineer.md` | RE, applied ML research, eval design |
| Infrastructure / Platform | `profiles/infrastructure.md` | Platform eng, infra, SRE, distributed systems |
| ML / AI Engineer | `profiles/ml-engineer.md` | MLE, applied AI, retrieval, NLP |
| Developer Tools / DevEx | `profiles/dev-tools.md` | DevTools, SDK, open-source, DX |
| Product Engineer | `profiles/product-engineer.md` | Full-stack, product eng, early-stage |
