# Product Engineer Profile

## One-liner
Product engineer who ships end-to-end — from knowledge graphs to interactive articles to adaptive language learning apps.

## Pitch (2-3 sentences)
I build products that sit at the intersection of research and users. Interlinear is an adaptive language learning app where morphosyntactic error classification feeds Thompson Sampling for concept mastery. The portfolio site features interactive data visualizations (Beta distribution widgets, animated SVG diagrams) that make dense technical concepts tangible.

## Resume emphasis order
1. Interlinear — adaptive language learning, CLTK + Reynir NLP, concept mastery tracking
2. Swae OS — federated GraphQL mesh across health data sources, cross-domain reasoning
3. Portfolio site — Astro, interactive MDX, hand-drawn SVG diagrams, annotation components
4. ComfyUI MCP — image generation as agent tooling, MCP interface
5. qortex as product — framework adapters as distribution strategy, open-core model
6. Prior: edX — education platform, content delivery at scale

## Proof points
- Interlinear: Classical Latin + Icelandic NLP pipelines, adaptive difficulty
- Portfolio: interactive Beta distribution widget, 4 hand-drawn SVG diagrams, annotation tooltips
- ComfyUI MCP: agent-driven image generation via MCP tools
- Swae OS: federated health data mesh (in progress)

## "If they ask about X, talk about Y"
- **"How do you think about product?"** → Research tooling nobody cares about unless you show value in one plot and six bullet points. The product surfaces are where the stack gets stress-tested.
- **"Full-stack?"** → Astro + TypeScript frontend, Python backend (qortex), Rust (planned), Ansible infra. Whatever the product needs.
- **"How do you prioritize?"** → Distribution over polish. Framework adapters exist so qortex can be tested across real applications. Products exist so the learning layer has real feedback signals.

## Target companies
Vercel, Linear, Notion, Figma, Replit, early-stage startups (Series A/B with real technical problems)
